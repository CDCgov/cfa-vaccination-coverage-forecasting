# Vaccination coverage forecasting

_Formerly known as Immunization Uptake Projections, or `iup`._

## Getting started

1. Read the docs at <https://cdcgov.github.io/cfa-vaccination-coverage-forecasting>, or build them locally with `mkdocs serve`
1. This project uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environment and dependency management. Ensure you can `uv sync`. Use the uv-managed virtual environment (e.g., by prepending `uv run`).
1. Run the [vignette](#vignette).

## Vignette

The vignette demonstrates an analytical pipeline:

1. Fit models to coverage data from past seasons
1. Use those trained models to forecast future coverage data in the latest season
1. Evaluate forecasts against observed values

### Data source

The vignette uses monthly estimates of season flu vaccination coverage, from the 2009/2010 season through the 2022/2023 season, as reported by the [National Immunization Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nis/about/index.html) and [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) and cleaned using [`nis-py-api`](https://github.com/CDCgov/nis-py-api) in December 2025.

### Running the vignette

1. Run the pipeline with `mise run vignette`.
   - Inspect `mise.toml` for how to use `make` to run with different numbers of threads and different configs.
2. Inspect `output/vignette/`:
   - `config.yaml`: a copy of the input config
   - `data.parquet`: the preprocessed, observed data
   - `scores.parquet`: model scores
   - `fits/`: pickled model fits, organized by forecast date
   - `plots/`: visualizations
   - `pred/`: model predictions, in Hive-partitioned parquet files
